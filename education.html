                <h3>Grad School Projects: </h3>
                <u>Exploring AI Content Detection with OpenAI API and Tensorflow</u> <br><br>
                For this project I created a few different models to see if I could
                predict whether or not a given text was generated by a human or an LLM.
                This was a supervised classification task, using text that I generated 
                using the OpenAI API via python script. <br><br>
                I found a dataset of Medium.com 
                articles on Kaggle and filtered for common topics, and then used the article 
                titles as prompts for the text generation, along with various metrics like 
                sentence length and word count. <br><br>
                I also generated multiple datasets with different roles of various levels of 
                student/writing ability. I had the LLM generate the articles with the same set of 
                instructions but as a 6th grader, 10th grader, and college student. <br><br>
                I then did a few different comparisons: <br>
                - AI vs. Human vanilla  TensorFlow model <br>
                - AI vs Human TensorFlow model with engineered NLP features like sentiment, sentence length, 
                grammatical complexity. <br>
                - AI vs Human finetuning model via OpenAI API <br>
                - AI vs Human finetuning model with aforementioned engineered
                variables <br>
                - Grade prediction TensorFlow model <br>
                - Grade prediction finetuning model <br>
