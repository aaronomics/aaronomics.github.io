                    I don't know how to make a website, but I do have a masters degree in 
                    applied statistics from Eastern Michigan University.

                    I went back to school in January 2020 at the age of 32 to get
                    my MS, but my undergrad degree is in Electronic Media & Film Studies.
                    That meant I had to take calc and stats courses before I could enter
                    the MS program, so I did. Calc 2 remote, async, and double speed as a
                    summer course was... rough.

                    I also like hockey, and music, and video games. I play beer league 
                    hockey, tenor saxophone, and I build computers and play a variety 
                    of indie games and competitive titles, along with the occassional AAA
                    title.
