                <h3>I've had a lot of different jobs...</h3>
                <p>Dishwasher, manager of a camping equipment store, specialty food buyer,
                    bar cook, car washer, loan officer at a credit union, etc.
                </p>
                <p>But now, I primarily work as a data scientist. I think of myself as a statistician,
                    because AI/data science is just statistics, but I don't really care about the title.

                    I currently work for Booz Allen as a Data Scientist.
                    I started working here in May of 2023 after completing their 
                    summer internship program in 2022.
                    
                    <br>

                    <h4>Projects:</h4>
                    
                    - NASA Pay Equity Assessment (PEA)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As part of the PEA team on this contract we conducted a thorough analysis
                    of pay outcomes at NASA. Most of the project is confidential at this time,
                    though it is not classified, but eventually the work will be publicly 
                    available.
