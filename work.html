                    I currently work for Booz Allen as a Data Scientist.
                    I started working here in May of 2023 after completing their 
                    summer internship program in 2022.

                    - NASA Pay Equity Assessment (PEA)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As part of the PEA team on this contract we conducted a thorough analysis
                    of pay outcomes at NASA. Most of the project is confidential at this time,
                    though it is not classified, but eventually the work will be publicly 
                    available.
