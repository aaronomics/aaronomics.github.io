                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I don't know how to make a website, but I do have a masters degree in 
                    applied statistics from Eastern Michigan University.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I went back to school in January 2020 at the age of 32 to get
                    my MS, but my undergrad degree is in Electronic Media & Film Studies.
                    That meant I had to take calc and stats courses before I could enter
                    the MS program, so I did. Calc 2 remote, async, and double speed as a
                    summer course was... rough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also like hockey, and music, and video games. I play beer league 
                    hockey, tenor saxophone, and I build computers and play a variety 
                    of indie games and competitive titles, along with the occassional AAA
                    title.

                    I currently work for Booz Allen as a Data Scientist.
                    I started working here in May of 2023 after completing their 
                    summer internship program in 2022.

                    <br>
                    As part of the PEA team on this contract we conducted a thorough analysis
                    of pay outcomes at NASA. Most of the project is confidential at this time,
                    though it is not classified, but eventually the work will be publically 
                    available.

                <h3>Grad School Projects: </h3>
                <u>Exploring AI Content Detection with OpenAI API and Tensorflow</u> <br><br>
                For this project I created a few different models to see if I could
                predict whether or not a given text was generated by a human or an LLM.
                This was a supervised classification task, using text that I generated 
                using the OpenAI API via python script. <br><br>
                I found a dataset of Medium.com 
                articles on Kaggle and filtered for common topics, and then used the article 
                titles as prompts for the text generation, along with various metrics like 
                sentence length and word count. <br><br>
                I also generated multiple datasets with different roles of various levels of 
                student/writing ability. I had the LLM generate the articles with the same set of 
                instructions but as a 6th grader, 10th grader, and college student. <br><br>
                I then did a few different comparisons: <br>
                - AI vs. Human vanilla  TensorFlow model <br>
                - AI vs Human TensorFlow model with engineered NLP features like sentiment, sentence length, 
                grammatical complexity. <br>
                - AI vs Human finetuning model via OpenAI API <br>
                - AI vs Human finetuning model with aforementioned engineered
                variables
                - Grade prediction TensorFlow model <br>
